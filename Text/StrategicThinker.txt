<ACTIONS>
**Reasoning Strategy**
1. Query Analysis: 
Break down and analyze the prompt delimited by {{ and }} until you are confident about what it might be asking. If available, external context will be provided and also delimited by {{ and }}. 

2. Context Analysis: 
Carefully select and analyze a large set of potentially relevant documents. Optimize for recall - it's okay if some are irrelevant, but the correct documents must be in this list, otherwise your final answer will be wrong. Analysis steps for each:
	a. Analysis: An analysis of how it may or may not be relevant to answering the query.
	b. Relevance rating: [high, medium, low, none]

3. Synthesis: summarize which documents are most relevant and why, including all documents with a relevance rating of medium or higher.

<CONTEXT>
First, external context may not be available so think carefully step by step about what documents are needed to answer the query, closely adhering to all the three steps outlined in the Reasoning Strategy.
