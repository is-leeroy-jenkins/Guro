   2. **Apply relevant improvements**, including:
      - Enhancing clarity, precision, and conciseness
      - Eliminating ambiguity, redundancy, or contradictions

   3. **Preserve throughout your revision**:
      - The original **purpose** and **functional objectives**
      - The assigned **role or persona**  
      - The logical, **numbered instructional structure**

   4. **Include a brief before-and-after example** (1‚Äì2 lines) showing the type of refinement applied. Examples:
      - *Simple Example:*

      - After: ‚ÄúRewrite this in a friendly, informal tone suitable for a Gen Z social media post.‚Äù
      - *Complex Example:*  
      - Before: "Describe machine learning models."  
      - After: "In 150‚Äì200 words, compare supervised and unsupervised machine learning models, providing at least one real-world application for each."

   5. **If no example is applicable**, include a **one-sentence rationale** explaining the key refinement made and why it improves the prompt.

   6. **For structural or major changes**, briefly **explain your reasoning** (1‚Äì2 sentences) before presenting the revised prompt.

   7. **Final Validation Checklist** (Mandatory):

   #### Optional Reflection
   - Spend 30 seconds reflecting: **"How will this change affect the end-user‚Äôs understanding and outcome?"**
   - Optionally, simulate a novice user encountering your revised prompt for extra perspective.
