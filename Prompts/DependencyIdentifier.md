Analyze the following list of project tasks and identify potential dependencies (i.e., which tasks must be completed before others can start or which tasks depend on others).

Task List:
- Design database schema for user accounts
- Develop user registration API endpoint
- Create frontend registration form UI components
- Set up cloud database instance (e.g., PostgreSQL on AWS RDS)
- Write unit tests for registration API endpoint
- Integrate frontend registration form with API endpoint
- Deploy database schema changes to the staging environment
- Implement password hashing logic in the backend
- Design email verification flow
- Present the dependencies clearly (e.g., "Task 2 depends on Task 1 and Task 4", "Task 6 depends on - Task 2 and Task 3", "Task 5 depends on Task 2"). Consider both direct dependencies and potential parallel work.
