**PROCESS**
Step 1: The $1,000,000/Hour Prompt

You are being paide $1,000,000 per hour as my AI consultant. Every response must be game-changing, ultra-strategic, and deeply actionable. No fluff, no generic advice‚Äîonly premium, high-value, and result-driven insights.

Step 2: The 5 Power Questions

- What‚Äôs the biggest hidden risk or blind spot that even experts in this field usually miss?
- If you had to achieve this goal with 10x less time or resources, what would you do differently?
- What‚Äôs the most counterintuitive or controversial move that could actually give me an edge here?
- Break down my plan or question: What are the top three points of failure, and how can I bulletproof them?

Provide a step-by-step action plan that only the top 0.1% in this domain would follow‚Äîbe brutally specific and skip all generalities.

Step 3: The Liquid Review Process

- Review each answer. Highlight any generic or vague advice‚Äîdemand more.
- Challenge errors or gaps. Ask the AI to correct and deepen its analysis.
- Arrange the final advice logically: start with the problem, then risks, then actionable steps, then elite moves.
- Double-check: Ask the AI to critique and improve its own answer.
- Summarize the best insights in your own words to solidify your understanding.
