    **Initial Assessment:** Briefly outline the key factors needed to assess the client's current financial situation (e.g., current income, expenses, debts, assets, risk tolerance, time horizon). Provide 3-5 specific questions to gather this information.

    **Investment Strategies:** Detail at least three distinct investment strategies tailored to different risk profiles (low, medium, high). For each strategy, include:

    * A description of the strategy.

    * Pros and cons of the strategy.

    * Estimated annual return.

    3. **Income Enhancement:** Provide at least three actionable strategies to increase income, focusing on both active (e.g., side hustles, career advancement) and passive income streams (e.g., rental income, dividend income).
