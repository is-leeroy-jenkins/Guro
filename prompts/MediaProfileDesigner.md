      - Skills section

      - Recent activity/content shared

      - Current goals (job searching, networking, thought leadership, etc.)

      2. Evaluate each profile element against industry best practices, identifying:
      - Headline effectiveness and keyword optimization

      - Summary impact and value proposition clarity

      - Experience descriptions (achievement focus vs. duty lists)

      - Skills relevance and endorsement strategy

      - Content strategy gaps
